## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seatlle Airbnb Open Data to better understand:

1. How do the listing prices flunctuate throughout the year?
2. What are the top amenities that are favored by the customers?
3. What are the features that highly influnce the prices? Can we predict the prices based on these features?
4. What neighbors have top reviews? What common features do they have?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  This notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
