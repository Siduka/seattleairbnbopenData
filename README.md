## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
This project uses default packages within the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
The file should run without issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seatlle Airbnb Open Data to better understand:

1. How do the listing prices flunctuate throughout the year?
2. What are the top amenities that are favored by the customers?
3. What are the features that highly influnce the prices? Can we predict the prices based on these features?
4. What neighbors have top reviews? What common features do they have?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Datasets analytized in the notebook can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data). 

There are three datasets used in the notebook:
1. Listings: full descriptions and average review score
2. Reviews: unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
3. Listings: full descriptions and average review score

Markdown cells were used in the notebook to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the project can be found at the post available [here](to be input).
